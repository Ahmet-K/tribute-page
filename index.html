      <p>Ickenham in Middlesex, in the West London Borough of Hillingdon, has held its own community Festival since 1976.
        <br> <br>
The Festival gives everyone an opportunity to join their community and enjoy themselves whilst learning more about our many local organisations and businesses. 
        <br> <br>
Everything is done on a local and voluntary basis and is mainly paid for by fund raising events and contributions.  
        <br> <br>
Throughout each two year period the Festival Team promote the aims of the Festival and generate funds and support.    
        <br> <br>
Last Festival, over Â£15,000 was raised for many good causes by the voluntary organisations and societies in Ickenham.   
        <br> <br>
The Festival Team are always glad of offers of support and time, no matter how small.  Have a look through this site to see what has been done in past years and,

      <h2 id="History">History Of The Festival</h2>
      <figure><center> <img class="image"  src="http://www.ickenhamfestival.org.uk/Fest1976.jpg"> </center>  </figure>  
      <p>The Ickenham Festival was founded in 1975.  Following a discussion about the number and variety of local groups and organisations in the community it was realised that many were unknown to the public. 
      <br><br>
A Committee was formed to arrange a week of activities open to all.  In addition, some special events were conceived with the aim of "providing an opportunity for  local groups, organisations or residents to present their interests to the people of Ickenham".  This first Festival was held in 1976 and was great success.  It was decided to present a similar week every other year. 
      <br><br>
It requires two years for us to raise the necessary funds for the Festival. Since them, that original concept has developed into a major Community Festival which is supported and attended by an increasingly large number of organisations in the community which serve the residents of Ickenham.  Every year, we present a trophy to recognise this service.
      <br><br>
We are totally self-financing and mainly depend on local fund-raising to meet all our costs.  We are grateful to local shops, businesses, groups and individuals who continue to give us their full support throughout the years to maintain this unique event. </p>
